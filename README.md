## 2/4/2020 - Basic Terrain Grid

In this update, I created a new 3D Unity project with a single empty object called a "MeshGenerator". It contains a Mesh Filter and Mesh Renderer subcomponent, in addition to a Mesh Generator C# script, which is where vertices and triangles are actually generated. This script creates a mesh and assigns it to the MeshFilter subcomponent of the object, and then calls a CreateShape() method. This method first creates a Vector3 array of size "(x + 1) * (y + 1)" called "vertices", then programmatically fills it with Vectors x and z values aligned in a grid, while y values are assigned using a Perlin Noise function. Another integer array called "triangles" keeps track of vertex indices generated in the "vertices" array. This array programmatically assigns the correct vertices together to create triangles with back-face culling. Once both arrays are generated, the mesh data is cleared, assigned with new vertices and triangles, and the RecalculateNormals() method is called to properly light the mesh.
